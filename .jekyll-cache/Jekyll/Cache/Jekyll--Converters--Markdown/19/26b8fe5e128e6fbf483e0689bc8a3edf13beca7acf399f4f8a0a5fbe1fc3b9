I"	<p>Why is the hardest thing about computer science not learning, but choosing <strong>what</strong> to learn?</p>

<h2 id="the-dilemma">The dilemma</h2>
<p>The dilemma that many (myself included) face as computer nerds. One that reflects on the chooser’s capabilities and interests and sometimes even personality. Software vs Hardware? Web or Systems? This my friends, is the <strong>real</strong> question. Am I going to write software for a distributed system or for the browsers? For servers or clients? This is a very important choice you have to make as a software engineer and it is also one that has the potential to affect the rest of your working life.</p>

<p>Are you going to be a revolutionary, writing algorithms with <em>insane</em> time complexities with more GitHub repos than real-life friends? Or a freelance hipster sitting at a coffeeshop with his macbook, making websites for tech-illiterate boomers?</p>

<p>It’s a tough question with no <strong>real</strong> answer.</p>

<p>The fact that in <em>general</em> people working with the web is more extroverted and talkative than the lonely goblin sitting in his basement writing C with Vim is not a coincidence.</p>

<p>Front-end and back-end is different in not only their skillsets but in personality aswell.</p>

<p>Also, since these fields differ so much, it is quite hard to jump from one to the other but don’t get me wrong it does <em>happen</em> but it is very rare to see it done successfully. There is a chance that you get locked into place the moment you pick either one of these fields. So what if you change your interests? or don’t like the crowd you’ve placed yourself in? These are also questions that someone like me ponders every day when the time slowly ticks down and the inevitable comes creeping closer and closer.</p>

<p>Now you might say that I’m being to drastic or that I am overexaggerating this. I might be. Or am I? Does writing blazingly fast C++ code and wiring React hooks inherit the same skillset? No! It surely doesn’t and it will never be that way. They are very different fields with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>What it ultimately boils down to is one single choice that a teenage boy has to make: Software or Hardware? and if I’m being honest, I don’t know which to pick.</p>
